When the rain poured outside, children gathered by the window to watch droplets race down the glass. Laughter filled the room as they made up stories about the tiny rivers forming. Cozy afternoons like these became cherished memories for everyone. On rainy evenings, families gathered around the dinner table to share laughter and warm soup. The gentle patter of drops on the roof created a rhythmic backdrop to friendly conversation. These moments wove memories that lingered long after the storm had passed.
